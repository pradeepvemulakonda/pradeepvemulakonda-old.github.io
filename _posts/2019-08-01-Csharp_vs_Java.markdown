### C# for Java Developers

This blog draws comparison between java and c# at an API level and tries to make it simple for C# or Java developers to gain either skills.

This is part of my journey in learning C# as a Java dev and thought it might help fellow devs to create this document.

#### Introduction:

Java and C# are both complied languages. Both languages are object oriented and support functional constructs.

Both languages are written to be compiled to an intermediate language. And need a virtual machine/runtime to execute on the target systems.

Both languages have automated garbage collection and use heap as the primary storage mechanism.

> Initially I will not dwell into the differences but will try to draw parallels between the language features and API's.
