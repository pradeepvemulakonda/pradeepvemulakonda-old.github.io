<li>Identify costs associated with maintaining and upgrading the systems and software.</li>

<li>Start your project to migrate all applications onto the strategic platform.</li>
<li>Start Phase 1</li>
<li>Get lost in business process translation.</li>
</ul>
Most of the time it is too hard to merge two software stacks and come up with a single unified strategic platform.
