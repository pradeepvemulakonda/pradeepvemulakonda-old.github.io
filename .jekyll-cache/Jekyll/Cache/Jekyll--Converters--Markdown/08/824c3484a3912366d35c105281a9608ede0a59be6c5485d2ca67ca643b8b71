I"Ì<p>This page draws comparison between java and c# at an API level and tries to make it simple for C# or Java developers to gain either skills.</p>

<p>This is part of my journey in learning C# as a Java dev and thought it might help fellow devs to create this document.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction:</h4>

<p>Java and C# are both complied languages. Both languages are object oriented and support functional constructs.</p>

<p>Both languages are written to be compiled to an intermediate language. And need a virtual machine/runtime to execute on the target systems.</p>

<p>Both languages have automated garbage collection and use heap as the primary storage mechanism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initially I will not dwell into the differences but will try to draw parallels between the language features and APIâ€™s.</p>
