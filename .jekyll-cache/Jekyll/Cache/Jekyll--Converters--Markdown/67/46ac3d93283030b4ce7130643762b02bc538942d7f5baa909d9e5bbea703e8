Most of today financial institutes see IT expenditure as an expense which eats into their profit margins. But, in todays world where you can order virtually anything on the Internet.&nbsp; Interestingly , you can buy the <a href="http://www.lunarregistry.com/moon-land/index.php">Moon</a>. But, try buying an insurance or apply for a loan and you would spend anywhere between 1 hour to days to get the policy or loan approved.<br />
<br />
Why does this happen?
<br />
Why organisations tend to see IT as an expense rather than as an Investment?<br />
<br />
From a finances perspective, IT expense does not convert to revenue. Something similar to using fuel in a Taxi. For a taxi driver the taxi is an investment and the fuel consumed is an expense. Even though his taxi does not run without fuel, it is always seen as an expense. This would mean, sometimes it might seem to be a good idea to use subpar fuel to improve profitability.<br />
<br />
Businesses cannot survive without IT it is the life blood of modern organisations.But from a finances perspective it looks like an never ending expense which business cannot avoid.
